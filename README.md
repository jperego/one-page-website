# one-page-website
A simple one-page academic website. 

This is a heavly edited version of a Start Bootstrap template, available here https://github.com/blackrockdigital/startbootstrap-grayscale/. 
The edits are meant to fit the original template to the needs of an academic website. It is supposed to function as a ready-to-use academic webapage for people knowing close to nothing about HTML and CSS.
